## Secure Network Setup for Small Business or Home Office 

## Objective
This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure network to protect resources, ensure encrypted remote access, and monitor for unauthorized activity.

## Key Components
1. **Firewall**
   - Purpose: Block unauthorized access and filter network traffic.
   - Tools: pfSense or OPNsense.
3. **VPN**
   - Purpose: Provide secure remote access to the network.
   - Tool: OpenVPN or WireGuard.
4. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
   - Purpose: Detect and log suspicious activity within the network.
   - Tool: Snort or Suricata.

## Security Goals (CIA)
1. **Confidentiality:** Encrypt sensitive data using VPNs.
2. **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized tampering of resources.
3. **Availability:** Protect systems from denial-of-service (DoS) and other downtime-causing attacks.

## Deliverables
1. A complete network setup with:
   - Configured firewall rules.
   - A functional VPN for secure remote access.
   - An IDS/IPS to monitor and log threats.
2. A detailed network diagram showing the layout.
3. Step-by-step documentation of the configuration process, including:
   - Screenshots.
   - Testing results.
   - Explanations of key decisions.

## Next Steps
1. Design the network diagram.
2. Set up a virtual lab environment to simulate the network.
3. Configure the firewall, VPN, and IDS/IPS.
